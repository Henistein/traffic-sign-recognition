# Implementation of GTSRB using PyTorch

The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. It consists of about 50,000 images in total which are classified into 43 categories with unbalanced distribution between the categories.

This project is a simple approach of a CNN built using PyTorch that is able to classify traffic signs using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. The model reaches about 99.5% test set accuracy.
